# CCNA-practical-
CCNA (200-301) networking labs performed on real Cisco routers and switches and validated using Cisco Packet Tracer. Covers routing, switching, VLANs, OSPF, NAT, ACLs, and network troubleshooting.



# CCNA Networking Labs – Real Cisco Devices & Packet Tracer

This repository contains a complete collection of **CCNA (200-301) networking labs**.
All configurations were **performed on physical Cisco routers and switches** during instructor-led training at **NITS Pune (Cisco Authorized Training Partner)** and also **recreated and validated using Cisco Packet Tracer**.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **real-world networking skills**, not just simulations.
